## Core Modules

1. **Main Application (`main.py`)**:
   The `main.py` serves as the entry point for running the simulations. It initializes the simulation environment, interacts with the user interface, and invokes the plotting mechanisms for visualization.

2. **Simulation Engine (`src/simulation.py`)**:
   This module contains the core logic to run simulations. It can be configured to model different scenarios and provides an API for fetching simulation results. The module is flexible and can be extended with new simulation models. The `Simulation` class is responsible for handling the state and progression of the simulation over time.

   - Key components:
     - `Simulation`: Main class that controls the state of the simulation.
     - `run_simulation()`: Method to initiate and run the simulation over time.
     - Configurable parameters for setting up different simulation environments.

3. **Plotting and Visualization (`src/plots.py`)**:
   The `plots.py` module provides functionalities to visualize the results of the simulations. It supports multiple types of plots such as line charts, histograms, and scatter plots. It uses libraries like `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for rendering high-quality visualizations.

   - Key components:
     - `plot_results()`: Function that generates the visual representation of the simulation outcomes.
     - `generate_histogram()`: Creates histograms based on simulated data.
     - `plot_time_series()`: Displays time series data for the evolution of the simulation over time.

4. **User Interface (`src/ui.py`)**:
   The user interface module is designed to interact with users, allowing them to configure simulation parameters and view real-time results. It can be a command-line interface or a GUI depending on the implementation.

   - Key components:
     - `UserInterface`: Class that provides methods for user input/output.
     - `display_menu()`: Function to present simulation options to the user.

5. **Utility Functions (`src/utils.py`)**:
   A collection of helper functions used across the codebase to handle common tasks, such as file I/O, data transformation, and mathematical operations.

   - Key components:
     - `save_to_file()`: Saves simulation results to a file.
     - `load_configuration()`: Loads configurations from a JSON or YAML file.

## Testing Framework

The project uses `pytest` as the testing framework. All unit tests are located in the `tests` directory. The test files ensure that the core functionalities of the simulation and user interface work as expected.

1. **Test Setup (`tests/conftest.py`)**:
   Contains shared fixtures and configuration settings for the test suite.

2. **Simulation Tests (`tests/test_simulation.py`)**:
   Tests the core simulation logic, ensuring correct progression and outcomes. It verifies that the state changes as expected when different simulation parameters are applied.

3. **UI Tests (`tests/test_ui.py`)**:
   Verifies the correctness of the user interface interactions. It checks that the UI correctly processes user inputs and provides accurate outputs.

To run the test suite, execute the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

This will run all tests and display the results in the terminal. Code coverage reports can also be generated using `pytest-cov`.

## Usage

1. **Running the Simulation**:
   To start the simulation, simply run the `main.py` script. Depending on how the user interface is designed, you may be prompted to input parameters or choose options from a menu.

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
